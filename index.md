## Projects

### Ocean Cleanup Microplastics Collector Robot *(Started 2025, To Be Finished 2026)*
- **What:** Floating robot detects microplastics, uses ferrofluid to attract contaminants, and magnetically retrieves ferrofluids and microplastics from water, and logs results.  
- **Impact:** TBD • Goal: A fully AI-powered robot that demonstrates how ferrofluid and robotics can be used to clean up our oceans!
- **Stack:** Python, OpenCV, Raspberry Pi, Servos, YOLO

### HAPHAICS: Hovercraft Analysis of Public Health via AI and Integrated Climate Sensors *(2024–2025)*
- **What:** Air-quality sensing + computer vision for crowd health cues (scans trash, and senses air conditions).  
- **Impact:**   A fully autonomous AI drone was made, demonstrated and recorded the health of St. Johns and Mount Pearl!
- **Stack:** Raspberry Pi, YOLO, OpenCV, Sen55X Air quality Sensor, Python
- **LearnMore:** View The [Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1calcGEeIDJPfd8RdX-mRUw7ZqKobDZGQIx8lA717wLA/edit?tab=t.0) or the [Presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGhvdntOY0/e1JNHzbvNHjafJ-2IJUxZQ/view?utm_content=DAGhvdntOY0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h96bf553db0)

### Recognizing Cancerous Cells in Breast Tissue Using The Python Keras Library (MVP) *(2023-2024)*
- **What:** Developed and demonstrated how artificial intelligence could be used to support the healthcare industry and diagnose cancer.  
- **Impact:** Showcased how AI can be used in the workforce; this project competed with the 450 top students across Canada!
- **Stack:** Python, Tensorflow, Keras
